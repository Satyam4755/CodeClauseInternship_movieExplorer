    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
      This <strong>Movie Explorer</strong> project was created as part of a task assigned by <strong>CodeClause</strong>. The goal was to build a clean, functional movie search interface using The Movie Database (TMDB) API. It allows users to search for movies, explore trending films, and view detailed information about each title in a smooth and engaging interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project was completed in approximately <strong>6 hours</strong> and is submitted under the <strong>Golden Level</strong> category. It showcases real-time API integration, responsive design, modal-based details view, and overall beginner-to-intermediate frontend development skills.
